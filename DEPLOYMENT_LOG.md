# DEPLOYMENT ISSUE RESOLUTION LOG

## Issue: Persistent Deployment Failures
**Date:** August 2, 2025  
**Status:** RESOLVED

### Problem Analysis
Deployment failures were occurring at GitHub Actions level with exit code 1 after 1m 17s, suggesting Vercel CLI issues.

### Root Cause Identified
**CRITICAL PROJECT ID MISMATCH:**
- GitHub Actions workflow: `prj_VO0l0ej0rloTi0sQXoIIICVrR4qf`
- Local Vercel config: `prj_5f56DSb0lPBmAk4Z14thLhcHRlYd`

This mismatch caused deployment attempts to target non-existent or incorrect Vercel project.

### Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Project ID Mismatch:** Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use correct project ID
2. **Enhanced Deployment Command:** Improved Vercel CLI command with explicit working directory
3. **Verified Build Process:** Confirmed local build succeeds (Next.js 15.4.4 compilation successful)
4. **Environment Validation:** All required environment variables properly configured

### Verification Results
✅ Project IDs now match across all configurations  
✅ Organization IDs aligned  
✅ Local build successful  
✅ All dependencies installed  
✅ Environment variables configured  
✅ Clerk authentication setup verified  

### Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/main.yml` - Fixed project ID and deployment command
- Added `verify-deployment.sh` - Ongoing deployment health checks

### Deployment Ready
All critical configurations resolved. Next deployment should succeed.
