## Sales Enablement Assets

### One-Liner Pitches
1. **For CTOs:** "Turn PRDs into production apps in 48 hours with AI agents"
2. **For CEOs:** "Cut development costs by 80% while shipping 10x faster"
3. **For VPs Eng:** "Give your team superpowers with autonomous coding agents"

### Objection Handlers
**"How is this different from GitHub Copilot?"**
> "Copilot helps write code. We build entire applications autonomously."

**"What about security?"**
> "SOC 2 compliant with enterprise SSO and audit logs. Your data never trains our models."

**"Too expensive?"**
> "One month pays for itself by replacing 3-6 months of development time."
