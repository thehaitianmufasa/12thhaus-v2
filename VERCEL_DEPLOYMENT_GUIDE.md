The 12thhaus v2.0 spiritual marketplace platform is now **production-ready** with:
- ✅ Zero build errors (18 pages generated successfully)
- ✅ All components properly configured for Next.js 15
- ✅ AuthContext with 'use client' directive

## 🔑 Required: Vercel Token Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Vercel Token
1. Go to https://vercel.com/account/tokens
2. Create a new token named "12thhaus-v2-deployment" 
3. Copy the token (starts with `vercel_xxx`)

### Step 2A: Local Deployment (Immediate)
```bash
cd /Users/mufasa/Desktop/Clients/12thhaus-v2

# Set your token and deploy
export VERCEL_TOKEN='your_actual_vercel_token_here'
./deploy-vercel.sh
```

### Step 2B: GitHub Actions Deployment (Automated)
1. Go to https://github.com/thehaitianmufasa/12thhaus-v2/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `VERCEL_TOKEN`
4. Value: Your Vercel token from Step 1
5. Save the secret

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Manual Deployment (Recommended First)
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/mufasa/Desktop/Clients/12thhaus-v2

# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel@latest

# Deploy to production
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### Option 2: GitHub Actions (After adding token)
Push any commit to main branch and GitHub Actions will automatically deploy.
