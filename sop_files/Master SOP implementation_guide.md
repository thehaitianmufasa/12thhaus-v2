# Master SOP Implementation Guide
*From Idea to Production-Ready Application*

## üöÄ Quick Start: Choose Your Path

### Path A: I Have a Clear Project Vision
**Use When:** You know what you want to build (features, users, goals)
**Time to Start:** 5 minutes
**Next Step:** Jump to "PROJECT ANALYSIS ACTIVATION"

### Path B: I Have an Idea But Need Structure
**Use When:** You have a concept but need help defining requirements
**Time to Start:** 30 minutes  
**Next Step:** Start with "PRD CREATION ACTIVATION"

---

## üìã PATH A: PROJECT ANALYSIS ACTIVATION
*When you already have a clear vision*

### Step 1: Create Your Simple PRD
Create a file called `[PROJECT_NAME]_PRD.md` with this basic template:

```markdown
# [PROJECT NAME] - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview
**What:** [One sentence describing what you're building]
**Who:** [Target users/customers]  
**Why:** [Problem you're solving/value you're delivering]

## Business Goals
**Revenue Model:** [How you'll make money]
**Success Metrics:** [How you'll measure success]
**Timeline:** [When you want to launch]
**Budget:** [Rough budget range]

## Core Features
**Must Have:**
- [Feature 1]: [Brief description]
- [Feature 2]: [Brief description]
- [Feature 3]: [Brief description]

**Nice to Have:**
- [Feature 4]: [Brief description]
- [Feature 5]: [Brief description]

## Users & Use Cases
**Primary User:** [Who will use this most]
**Primary Use Case:** [Main thing they'll do]
**Secondary Users:** [Other user types]
**Secondary Use Cases:** [Other important scenarios]

## Technical Considerations
**Integrations Needed:** [Third-party services required]
**Performance Requirements:** [Speed, scale, availability needs]

## Your Tasks
1. **Tier Selection:** Analyze the PRD and select MVP/Business/Enterprise tier
2. **Module Architecture:** Design the module structure and dependencies  
3. **Build Sequence:** Define the optimal development order
4. **MCP Allocation:** Assign MCP servers to each module type
5. **Agent Briefings:** Create activation packages for each module agent

## Resources Available
- Master Project SOP (attached)
- Project PRD: [Attach your PRD file]
- MCP Servers: Filesystem, Docker Gateway, N8N Automation, Vercel Deployment, Apify Scraping

## Expected Deliverables
- Project tier selection with reasoning
- Complete module architecture diagram
- Build sequence with dependencies
- Agent briefing packages for each module
- Integration and testing plan

## Quality Standards
Follow the billion-dollar development standards from the Master SOP. Ensure scalability, security, and maintainability from day one.

Please analyze the attached PRD and provide the complete project setup.
```

## üìù PATH B: PRD CREATION ACTIVATION  
*When you need help structuring your idea*

### Step 1: Capture Your Idea
Write down your basic concept:

```markdown
# [PROJECT NAME] - Initial Concept

## The Idea
[Describe your idea in 2-3 paragraphs]

## The Problem
[What problem does this solve?]

## The Users
[Who would use this?]

## Success Vision
[What does success look like in 1 year?]

## Inspiration/Examples
[Any similar products or companies that inspire this?]

## Initial Thoughts
[Any other relevant details, constraints, or ideas]
```

### Step 2: Activate PRD Creation Agent
Copy this exact prompt:

```markdown
# PRD CREATION REQUEST

## Context  
You are the PRD Creation Agent using the Master Project SOP framework. Your job is to transform a basic project idea into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document that can drive billion-dollar development.

## Your Task
Transform the attached project concept into a complete PRD that includes:
- Clear business model and revenue strategy
- Detailed feature specifications  
- User personas and use cases
- Technical architecture considerations
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Timeline and resource requirements
- Risk assessment and mitigation

## Resources Available
- Master Project SOP (reference for tier requirements)
- Project concept: [Attach your concept file]
- Industry knowledge and best practices

## Quality Standards
Create a PRD that:
- Clearly defines project scope and boundaries
- Provides enough detail for accurate tier selection
- Includes all information needed for module architecture
- Follows enterprise-grade documentation standards
- Sets up the project for scalable, sustainable growth

## Expected Deliverable
Complete PRD file ready for Project Analysis Agent to process.

Please create a comprehensive PRD from the attached project concept.
```

### Step 3: After PRD Creation
Once you have your PRD, proceed to "PROJECT ANALYSIS ACTIVATION" above.

## üîß MODULE AGENT ACTIVATION
*After project analysis is complete*

### Step 1: Agent Assignment
The Project Analysis Agent will provide you with specific agent briefings. Each briefing will look like this:

```markdown
# AGENT BRIEFING: [MODULE_NAME]

## Your Mission
**Module:** [Specific module name and purpose]
**Build Phase:** [Foundation/Business/Experience]
**Project Tier:** [MVP/Business/Enterprise]

## Your Resources
**MCP Servers:** [Specific tools assigned to this module]
**Dependencies:** [Other modules you need to wait for]
**Memory File:** [MODULE_NAME]_claude_memory.md

[... complete briefing details ...]
```

### Step 2: Activate Module Agents
For each module, use this activation prompt:

```markdown
# MODULE AGENT ACTIVATION

## Context
You are the [MODULE_NAME] Agent following the Master Project SOP framework. You will build one specific module of a larger application.

## Your Assignment
[Paste the complete agent briefing from Project Analysis Agent]

## Resources Available
- Master Project SOP (for reference and standards)
- MCP Servers: [List from briefing]
- Project Architecture: [From Project Analysis Agent]
- Memory File: Create and maintain [MODULE_NAME]_claude_memory.md

## Build Protocol
1. **Setup:** Create your Claude.md memory file
2. **Development:** Build your module following SOP standards
3. **Testing:** Complete all quality gates independently
4. **Integration:** Test with dependent modules
5. **Handoff:** Provide complete documentation package

## Success Criteria
[From agent briefing - specific to this module]

You may begin building your module. Update your memory file after every significant change.
```
