# Agent Recalibration Protocol
*Stop, Reset, Refocus - Get Back on Track*

## üõë IMMEDIATE RECALIBRATION PROMPT

```markdown
# STOP AND RECALIBRATE

## You seem to be going off track. Let's reset and refocus.

### Step 1: PAUSE CURRENT WORK
Stop what you're doing right now. Don't continue with the current approach.

### Step 2: RE-READ YOUR CORE CONTEXT
Go back and re-read:
1. **Your specific module assignment** - What exact module are you supposed to build?
2. **Your success criteria** - What does done look like for YOUR module only?
3. **Your module boundaries** - What do you own vs what other modules handle?
4. **The Master Project SOP standards** - What quality level is required?

### Step 3: IDENTIFY THE DRIFT
Answer these questions:
- What were you just working on?
- Is that within your module boundaries? 
- Does it match your assigned success criteria?
- Are you following the tier-appropriate approach (MVP/Business/Enterprise)?
- Are you building features that belong to other modules?

### Step 4: RESET TO LAST GOOD STATE
- What was the last thing you completed successfully?
- What was working correctly before you started this current task?
- Return to that stable point mentally

### Step 5: REFOCUS ON YOUR MISSION
State clearly:
- **Your module name and purpose**
- **Your current phase** (Foundation/Business/Experience)
- **Your next specific task** (one concrete thing to build)
- **Your success criteria** for that specific task

### Step 6: SIMPLIFIED NEXT ACTION
Pick ONE simple, specific task that:
- Is clearly within your module boundaries
- Follows the established patterns
- Can be completed and tested independently
- Moves toward your module's success criteria

Do not overcomplicate. Build one thing, test it, stabilize it.

## Return to disciplined, focused development.
```

## üéØ QUICK RECALIBRATION COMMANDS

### **For Scope Creep:**
```markdown
"RECALIBRATE: You're building features outside your module. Re-read your module boundaries and focus only on [SPECIFIC MODULE NAME] functionality."
```

### **For Over-Engineering:**
```markdown
"RECALIBRATE: You're over-complicating this. Remember we're building [MVP/Business/Enterprise] tier. Simplify and focus on core requirements only."
```

### **For Wrong Technology:**
```markdown
"RECALIBRATE: You're using technologies not specified in the architecture. Return to the approved tech stack and implementation approach."
```

### **For Breaking Patterns:**
```markdown
"RECALIBRATE: You're not following the established code patterns. Review previous modules and maintain consistency."
```

### **For Testing Neglect:**
```markdown
"RECALIBRATE: You're building without testing. Stop, test what you have, then continue with proper testing protocol."
```

## üîß SPECIFIC RECALIBRATION SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Agent Building Wrong Features
**Signs:** Working on user interface when assigned to database module
```markdown
RECALIBRATE: You are the [DATABASE_MODULE] agent. You should be building data models and database operations, NOT user interface components. That's handled by the UI_MODULE agent.

Focus only on:
- Database schema and migrations  
- Data models and repositories
- Database CRUD operations
- Database testing and validation

Stop all UI work immediately.
```

### Scenario 2: Agent Over-Engineering for Tier
**Signs:** Building enterprise features for MVP project
```markdown
RECALIBRATE: This is an MVP-tier project. You're building enterprise-level complexity that's not needed.

Return to MVP requirements:
- Basic functionality only
- Simple, working solutions
- No advanced features
- Focus on speed to market

Remove the complex architecture and build the simplest version that works.
```

### Scenario 3: Agent Breaking Module Boundaries
**Signs:** Auth module trying to handle billing logic
```markdown
RECALIBRATE: You are the AUTH_SECURITY module. Billing logic belongs to the BILLING_PAYMENTS module.

Your boundaries are:
- User authentication (login/logout)
- Password management  
- Session handling
- Basic user roles

Stop working on billing features. Focus only on authentication.
```

### Scenario 4: Agent Ignoring Standards
**Signs:** Not following code quality or testing requirements
```markdown
RECALIBRATE: You're not following the Master Project SOP standards.

Required standards:
- 90% test coverage minimum
- Proper error handling
- Clean, documented code
- API documentation
- Integration testing

Stop and add the missing quality elements before proceeding.
```

## üé™ PREVENTION STRATEGIES

### Regular Check-ins (Every 30 minutes):
```markdown
QUICK CHECK: Am I still building the right thing for my assigned module?
- [ ] Working on my module's features only
- [ ] Following the approved architecture  
- [ ] Meeting the tier requirements
- [ ] Testing as I go
- [ ] Maintaining code quality
```

### Boundary Reinforcement:
```markdown
BOUNDARY CHECK: Before starting any new task, ask:
- Is this within my module's responsibility?
- Do I need to coordinate with another module agent?
- Am I following the established patterns?
- Does this match the project tier requirements?
```

## üö® EMERGENCY RESET COMMAND

### When Things Go Really Wrong:
```markdown
# EMERGENCY RESET

STOP ALL WORK IMMEDIATELY.

1. **Revert to last known good state** - Go back to when things were working
2. **Re-read your original briefing** - What were you actually supposed to build?
3. **Check your memory file** - What was your last successful progress?
4. **Start with one simple task** - Pick the smallest next step
5. **Test immediately** - Make sure it works before continuing

Do not attempt to fix everything at once. Build one small thing, test it, then proceed carefully.

You are building [MODULE_NAME] for a [TIER] project. Focus only on that.
```

## üìä RECALIBRATION SUCCESS INDICATORS

### You're Back on Track When:
- ‚úÖ Working on features within your module boundaries
- ‚úÖ Following the appropriate tier complexity level
- ‚úÖ Building incrementally with testing
- ‚úÖ Code matches established patterns
- ‚úÖ Progress toward your specific success criteria

### Still Off Track If:
- ‚ùå Building features for other modules
- ‚ùå Over-engineering for the project tier
- ‚ùå Skipping testing and quality checks
- ‚ùå Breaking architectural patterns
- ‚ùå Unclear what you're supposed to be building

## üéØ QUICK REFERENCE RECALIBRATION

### **The 3-Question Reset:**
1. **What module am I building?** [Specific name and purpose]
2. **What's my next specific task?** [One concrete thing]
3. **How do I test it's working?** [Clear success criteria]

### **The Boundary Check:**
- Am I building only what my module owns?
- Am I using the right technologies?
- Am I following the tier requirements?
- Am I maintaining quality standards?

**Remember: Better to build less correctly than more incorrectly.**
