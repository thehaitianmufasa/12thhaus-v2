## ðŸš€ Execution Commands

### Run Complete Phase 4A Test Suite:
```bash
cd /Users/mufasa/Desktop/langgraph-multi-agent
source venv/bin/activate
python testing/run_phase_4a.py
```

### Run Individual Test Components:

**Unit Tests:**
```bash
python -m pytest testing/unit/ -v --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

**E2E Tests:**
```bash
python -m pytest testing/e2e/ -v --headed
```

**Performance Tests:**
```bash
# Lighthouse
python testing/performance/lighthouse_test.py

# k6 Load Test
k6 run testing/performance/load_test.js
```

**Security Audit:**
```bash
python testing/security/security_audit.py
```

### Quick Test Status Check:
```bash
python -m pytest --collect-only | grep -c "test"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Success Metrics

### Phase 4A Completion Criteria:
- âœ… 80%+ test coverage
- âœ… All critical paths tested
- âœ… Performance benchmarks met
- âœ… No critical security vulnerabilities
- âœ… Load testing validates 1000+ users

### Phase 4B Completion Criteria:
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage
- [ ] Full production monitoring
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] CI/CD fully automated
- [ ] Customer success materials ready

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Playwright Installation:**
   ```bash
   playwright install chromium
   ```

2. **k6 Installation (macOS):**
   ```bash
   brew install k6
   ```

3. **Missing Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Port Conflicts:**
   - Ensure ports 8000, 3000, 5432 are available
   - Check with: `lsof -i :8000`
